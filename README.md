# Hi everyone in Women in tech Oslo repo

We are on our way to making it more accessible to you to contribute to the mission of empowering and encouraging more women to thrive in tech field and lower the barriers of entry. Join the [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wit-oslo/shared_invite/zt-61vb6rn9-t0~_6NXQTmT8gXNn5MeE5A) to say hi ✌🏾✌🏼✌🏿  

### Why was this repo created?

For the last 3.5 years, we have arranged workshops and conferences where many amazing people participated. These events were created by our dedicated team on a voluntary basis. From time to time we get questions like:
How can I join your team? How can I contribute to the community? How can we sponsor an event? Can I be a speaker? and many more questions. We are extremely grateful to have such an engaging community, but we also see how much energy and resources it takes to maintain everything on our own.


### What is the alternative?

Let's try to create an ecosystem where everyone can contribute to the development of the community: share knowledge, mentor or get a mentor, find a study body, help with career advice, etc.


### How do we do it?
